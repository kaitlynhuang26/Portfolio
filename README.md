### Hi! I'm Kaitlyn!

Hi! I’m Kaitlyn Widjaja, a Junior majoring in Statistics at UC Berkeley. I want to be a Data Scientist who not only helps businesses grow but also creates solutions that make a real difference in people's lives. For me, data isn’t just about numbers—it’s about finding smarter ways to solve problems, improve efficiency, and make technology more accessible.

My diverse experiences—from internships to leadership roles—have shaped me into an adaptable, curious, and impact-oriented professional with a strong foundation in programming and data analytics (Python, Java, C++, NumPy, Pandas, SQL, SAS, Excel), visualization (Tableau, Matplotlib), and effectively communicating data insights.
