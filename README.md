### Projects 
Analyzing Incarceration Trends with SAS
- Utilized SAS software to analyze the relationship between father figure imprisonment, closeness, and child incarceration likelihood. 
- Cleaned and formatted datasets, addressing missing values and labeling categorical variables for clarity. 
- Created visualizations like bar charts and bivariate analyses to uncover trends. 
- Discovered higher incarceration rates for children with imprisoned or distant father figures.
